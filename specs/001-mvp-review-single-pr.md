## Problem

No tool exists to review pull requests using the local Claude Code CLI with full project context (CLAUDE.md, coding guidelines, subagents, `/code-review` skill). The existing GitHub Actions approach (`claude-code-action`) runs generic reviews without project-specific rules.

## Goal

After completion, a Go CLI tool `pr-reviewer` accepts a single GitHub PR URL, resolves the repo to a local checkout via config, creates a temporary git worktree for the PR branch, runs Claude Code `/code-review` in that worktree, and posts the review as a comment on the PR.

## Non-goals

- Bitbucket Server support — spec 003
- Approve/request-changes verdict — spec 002
- Batch/polling mode (review all open PRs)
- Creating or merging PRs
- Reviewing without a local checkout (no cloning)
- Interactive mode / TUI

## Desired Behavior

1. User runs `pr-reviewer <URL>` where URL is a GitHub PR
2. Tool parses the URL to extract owner, repo, and PR number
3. Tool looks up the local repo path from `~/.pr-reviewer.yaml` config
4. Tool fetches the PR metadata (source branch) via `gh pr view`
5. Tool runs `git fetch` in the local repo to ensure branches are up to date
6. Tool creates a git worktree at a temp path for the PR's source branch
7. Tool runs `claude --print "/code-review"` in the worktree directory — this picks up the repo's CLAUDE.md and all project-specific context
8. Tool posts the Claude output as a PR comment via `gh pr comment`
9. Tool removes the git worktree and cleans up
10. Tool exits 0 on success, non-zero on failure with clear error message

## Constraints

- Config file location: `~/.pr-reviewer.yaml`
- Must use `gh` CLI for GitHub operations (already authenticated)
- Must use `git worktree add/remove` — never checkout in the main working tree
- Must use `claude` CLI — not the SDK, not the API directly
- Worktree path: `<repo-path>/.worktrees/pr-review-<pr-number>` (inside repo, not /tmp)
- Always clean up worktree on exit (including on error/signal)

## Config Format

```yaml
# ~/.pr-reviewer.yaml
repos:
  - url: https://github.com/bborbe/teamvault-docker
    path: /Users/bborbe/Documents/workspaces/teamvault-docker
  - url: https://github.com/bborbe/pr-reviewer
    path: /Users/bborbe/Documents/workspaces/pr-reviewer
```

GitHub auth is handled by `gh` CLI — no token needed in config.

## URL Pattern

```
https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/pull/{number}
```
Extract: owner, repo, PR number.
Repo URL for config lookup: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}`

## Failure Modes

| Trigger | Expected behavior | Recovery |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| Unknown URL format | Exit 1 with "unsupported URL format: <url>" | User fixes URL |
| Repo not in config | Exit 1 with "repo not found in config, add to ~/.pr-reviewer.yaml: <url>" | User adds mapping |
| Local path doesn't exist | Exit 1 with "local path not found: <path>" | User clones repo |
| Local path not a git repo | Exit 1 with "not a git repo: <path>" | User checks path |
| git fetch fails | Exit 1 with git error | User checks network/auth |
| PR branch not found after fetch | Exit 1 with "branch not found: <branch>" | User checks PR is open |
| Worktree creation fails | Exit 1 with git error | User checks for conflicts |
| claude CLI not found | Exit 1 with "claude not found in PATH" | User installs Claude Code |
| claude exits non-zero | Exit 1 with claude's stderr | User investigates |
| Posting comment fails | Exit 1 with API error, but print review to stdout as fallback | User posts manually |
| Signal (SIGINT/SIGTERM) | Clean up worktree, then exit | Automatic |

## Security / Abuse Cases

- URL parsing: validate against GitHub pattern only, reject anything else
- Worktree path: derived deterministically from repo path + PR number, no user-controlled path components
- Claude output: posted as-is — trusted internal tool, no sanitization needed

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `pr-reviewer https://github.com/bborbe/teamvault-docker/pull/4` produces a review comment on the PR
- [ ] Unknown URL exits 1 with helpful message
- [ ] Missing repo in config exits 1 with helpful message
- [ ] Worktree is cleaned up after success
- [ ] Worktree is cleaned up after failure
- [ ] Worktree is cleaned up after SIGINT
- [ ] Review is printed to stdout even if posting fails

## Verification

```
make precommit
```

## Do-Nothing Option

Continue using GitHub Actions `claude-code-action` for GitHub. Reviews remain generic without project-specific rules. Acceptable for repos with simple conventions, but inadequate for repos with detailed CLAUDE.md and custom `/code-review` skills.
