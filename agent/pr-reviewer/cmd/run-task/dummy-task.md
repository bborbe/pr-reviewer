## Plan

Diff main...HEAD, inspect each change for correctness, security, and style; report verdict.

## Review

I have all the information needed for the review. Let me compile the final JSON.

{"verdict":"comment","summary":"The Team Health Check feature is well-structured and follows project conventions. No
critical or security issues found. Two minor bugs and a few low-priority gaps in test coverage.","
comments":[{"file":"apps/page/src/server/api/routers/health-check.ts","line":42,"severity":"minor","message":"If all 10 retry attempts produce a colliding code, the loop exits silently and the
`create()` call on line 42 hits the DB unique constraint, surfacing as an unhandled Prisma P2002 error rather than a meaningful TRPCError. Add
`else { throw new TRPCError({ code: 'INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR', message: 'Could not generate unique session code' }) }` after the loop, or check the counter after it."},{"file":"apps/page/src/server/api/routers/health-check.ts","line":98,"severity":"minor","message":"
`include: { ratings: true }` returns full rating payloads (10 integer fields + metadata per participant) for every past session of the team. The TeamHistory component only uses
`s.ratings.length` (results/page.tsx:207). Replace with `include: { ratings: { select: { id: true } } }` or use
`_count: { select: { ratings: true } }` to avoid over-fetching."},{"file":"apps/page/src/server/api/routers/health-check.ts","line":93,"severity":"nit","message":"
`teamName: z.string()` has no
`.min(1).max(100)` constraint, unlike all other string inputs in the router. An empty or very long teamName would produce a vacuous or slow DB query."},{"file":"apps/page/src/lib/
__tests
__/health-check-utils.test.ts","line":1,"severity":"minor","message":"No integration tests exist for the five tRPC procedures (createSession, getSession, submitRating, getResults, getTeamSessions). Project testing rules require tRPC to be tested through the caller API. At minimum, the happy-path and the NOT_FOUND branch of submitRating should be covered."}],"
concerns_addressed":["correctness: retry loop in createSession exits without error after exhaustion — raised as minor comment on health-check.ts:42","security: all inputs validated with Zod (min/max/range), DB constraints enforce uniqueness and cascade deletes, no XSS vectors — no issues found","test coverage: unit tests present for computeAverages and HEALTH_AREAS constants; integration tests for tRPC procedures missing — raised as minor comment","over-fetching: getTeamSessions returns full rating rows while only count is consumed — raised as minor comment on health-check.ts:98"]}
