<objective>
Add a comprehensive README.md for the code-reviewer project.
</objective>

<context>
Read CLAUDE.md for project conventions.
Read ALL markdown files in ~/Documents/workspaces/coding-guidelines/ for Go patterns.
Read specs/001-mvp-review-single-pr.md for feature overview.
Read main.go for CLI usage and flags.
Read pkg/config/config.go for config structure.
Precondition: project has no README.md at all.
</context>

<requirements>
1. Create README.md with these sections:
   - Title and one-line description
   - What it does (2-3 sentences)
   - Installation (`go install`)
   - Usage: `code-reviewer [-v] <pr-url>`
   - Configuration: `~/.code-reviewer.yaml` with full example showing all fields (github.token, model, repos with url/path/reviewCommand)
   - How it works (numbered steps: parse URL → find repo → fetch branch → worktree → claude review → post comment → cleanup)
   - Requirements: Go 1.26+, claude CLI, gh CLI
   - License: BSD (link to LICENSE file)

2. Keep it concise — no badges, no contributing section, no changelog link.

3. Use the actual config structure from pkg/config/config.go for the YAML example.

4. Show both minimal and full config examples.
